##TiltedParticle

Do to interdepencies with 3D code and change class structure. This code snippet is not editable. 

Basic Idea - Is to store 2 variables in the particle object which are 2 rotations ( first to rotate perogee and second to tilt that out of the plane) 

The tilt out of the plane decreases exponentially. Particle movement calculated as if in a ring - then render displaying them tilted.
